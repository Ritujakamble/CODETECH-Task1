Overview of the Project


Objective: Java is an Object-oriented programming
Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means that code is written in classes and data is stored as objects. OOP concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism allow developers to create reusable methods and variables.
 The main purpose of the JAVA programming language is to provide programmers with one-time write and run, anywhere functionality. The compiled Java code can be run on any platform that supports Java without recompiling.
